## Election-Audit Summary 

For future elections the current script can be used to list the same or more number of counties and candidates to quantify the number of votes for each category.

For other elections that included data on socioeconomic factors on the county population (gender, race, religion, income, age, education etc) the script can be modify to quantify the number and percentage of voters on each socioeconomic category. This would provide additional insights into how these factors affect voters turnout and/or the election's results 

Also, the script could be modify if the data included polital preferences of both candidates and voters to analyze which political party won, the number of votes and percentage of votes
